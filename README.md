# Pirate Game

This application is hosted at <https://f2reninj5.xyz/pirate>.

This web application serves as a tool for someone who wants to host a traditional pen-and-paper version of the Pirate Game.

You will want to share your screen with all the players via a classroom projector, TV, or by screen sharing if playing remotely.

## Setting up the game

1. Each player must have a printed game sheet from the Sheets window (which sheet to print is indicated by how many players there are).
2. Each player should fill their grid with the different tiles listed on the right-hand side. The numbers in brackets indicate how many of each tile should be placed in the grid.
3. Each player begins with 0 cash and 0 money in their bank.

## Playing the game

1. The host will click the Random Cell button and each player will cross of the grid square selected.
2. For each of the non-cash tiles, the host will ask the players if any of them landed on that tile.
    1. If one player has landed on the named tile, then they should do whatever the tile's rule says (the tiles on the host's screen also display these rules).
    2. If multiple players have landed on the named tile, the Player Shuffler is to be used to create a random order - the host will enter all the player names and then click Shuffle.
3. If there are players who have landed on the Choose tile, the host will open the Choose Queue window and enter the player names, then add them to the queue using the Shuffle and Merge button.
4. If the choose queue has players in it, then the player at the top of the choose queue should choose which grid square to select next.
    1. The host should click on the grid square to select it.
    2. The player at the top of the queue will automatically be removed from the queue.
    3. Continue to step 2.
5. If there are no players in the choose queue, then continue to step 1.

## Winning the game

The winner of the game is the player who has the most money (cash and bank combined) after the grid has been completed or after a set period of time, e.g. 1 hour, has passed.
