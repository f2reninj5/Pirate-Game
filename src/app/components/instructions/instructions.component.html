<p>This web application serves as a tool for someone who wants to host a traditional pen-and-paper version of the Pirate Game.</p>
<p>You will want to share your screen with all the players via a classroom projector, TV, or by screen sharing if playing remotely.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-game">Setting up the game</h2>
<ol>
<li>Each player must have a printed game sheet from the <em>Sheets</em> window (which sheet to print is indicated by how many players there are).</li>
<li>Each player should fill their grid with the different tiles listed on the right-hand side. The numbers in brackets indicate how many of each tile should be placed in the grid.</li>
<li>Each player begins with 0 cash and 0 money in their bank.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the game</h2>
<ol>
<li>The host will click the <em>Random Cell</em> button and each player will cross of the grid square selected.</li>
<li>For each of the non-cash tiles, the host will ask the players if any of them landed on that tile.<ol>
<li>If one player has landed on the named tile, then they should do whatever the tile&#39;s rule says (the tiles on the host&#39;s screen also display these rules).</li>
<li>If multiple players have landed on the named tile, the <em>Player Shuffler</em> is to be used to create a random order - the host will enter all the player names and then click <em>Shuffle</em>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are players who have landed on the <em>Choose</em> tile, the host will open the <em>Choose Queue</em> window and enter the player names, then add them to the queue using the <em>Shuffle and Merge</em> button.</li>
<li>If the choose queue has players in it, then the player at the top of the choose queue should choose which grid square to select next.<ol>
<li>The host should click on the grid square to select it.</li>
<li>The player at the top of the queue will automatically be removed from the queue.</li>
<li>Continue to step 2.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are no players in the choose queue, then continue to step 1.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="winning-the-game">Winning the game</h2>
<p>The winner of the game is the player who has the most money (cash and bank combined) after the grid has been completed or after a set period of time, e.g. 1 hour, has passed.</p>
